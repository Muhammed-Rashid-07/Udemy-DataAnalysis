Data Analysis of Udemy Courses
This repository contains a data analysis project of Udemy courses. The dataset used in this analysis is available on Kaggle here.

Motivation
The motivation behind this analysis was to explore and gain insights into the Udemy platform and its courses. I was interested in answering questions such as:

What are the most popular courses on Udemy?
Which category has the highest number of courses?
What is the distribution of course prices?
How do course ratings and number of subscribers correlate?
Technologies Used
The following technologies were used for this analysis:

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Contents
The repository contains the following files:

udemy_data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the analysis.
data/udemy_courses.csv: CSV file containing the Udemy courses dataset.
images/: Directory containing the visualizations generated by the analysis.
Summary of Findings
After conducting the analysis, I found the following insights:

The most popular courses on Udemy are in the categories of Web Development, Business Finance, and Musical Instruments.
The category with the highest number of courses is Web Development.
The distribution of course prices is right-skewed, with most courses priced between $0 and $200.
There is a weak positive correlation between course ratings and number of subscribers.
Acknowledgments
